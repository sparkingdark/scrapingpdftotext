Academic Integrity 

 

 
 

You are expected to exhibit honesty and use ethical behaviour in all aspects of the learning process. 
Academic credentials you earn are rooted in principles of honesty and academic integrity. 
It is your 
responsibility to understand what constitutes academic dishonesty. 

Academic dishonesty is to knowingly act or fail to act in a way that results or could result in unearned 
academic credit or advantage. This behaviour can result in serious consequences, e.g. the grade of 
zero on an assignment, loss of credit with a notation on the transcript (notation reads: “Grade of F 
assigned for academic dishonesty”), and/or suspension or expulsion from the university. For 
information on the various types of academic dishonesty please refer to the
Academic Integrity 
 
located at https://secretariat.mcmaster.ca/university-policies-procedures- guidelines/ 
 
,
Policy
​

The following illustrates only three forms of academic dishonesty: 

● plagiarism, e.g. the submission of work that is not one’s own or for which other credit has been 

obtained. 

● improper collaboration in group work. 

● copying or using unauthorized aids in tests and examinations. 

Authenticity/Plagiarism Detection 

Some courses may 
use a web-based service (Turnitin.com) to reveal authenticity and ownership of 
​
student submitted work. For courses using such software, students will be expected to submit their 
work electronically either directly to Turnitin.com or via an online learning platform (e.g. Avenue to 
Learn, etc.) using plagiarism detection (a service supported by Turnitin.com) so it can be checked for 
academic dishonesty. 
  
Students who do not wish their work to be submitted through the plagiarism detection software must 
inform the Instructor before the assignment is due. No penalty will be assigned to a student who does 
not submit work to the plagiarism detection software. 
verification that standards of academic integrity have been upheld 
software, etc.). For more details about McMaster’s use of Turnitin.com please go to 
www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity

All submitted work is subject to normal 
(e.g., on-line search, other 

Courses with an On-line Element 

Some courses may 
use on-line elements (e.g. e-mail, Avenue to Learn, LearnLink, web pages, capa, 
​
Moodle, Echo360, Microsoft Teams, ThinkingCap, etc.). Students should be aware that, when they 
access the electronic components of a course using these elements, private information such as first and 
last names, user names for the McMaster e-mail accounts, and program affiliation may become

apparent to all other students in the same course. The available information is dependent on the 
technology used. Continuation in a course that uses on-line elements will be deemed consent to this 
disclosure. If you have any questions or concerns about such disclosure please discuss this with the 
course instructor. 
 

Online Proctoring 

Some courses may 
use online proctoring software for tests and exams. This software may require 
students to turn on their video camera, present identification, monitor and record their computer 
activities, and/or lock/restrict their browser or other applications/software during tests or exams. This 
software may be required to be installed before the test/exam begins. 
 

Conduct Expectations 

As a McMaster student, you have the right to experience, and the responsibility to demonstrate, 
respectful and dignified interactions within all of our living, learning and working communities. These 
expectations are described in the
(the “Code”). All students 
 
Code of Student Rights & Responsibilities
 
​
​
share the responsibility of maintaining a positive environment for the academic and personal growth 
of all McMaster community members, 

whether in person or online. 

 

It is essential that students be mindful of their interactions online, as the Code remains in effect in 
virtual learning environments. The Code applies to any interactions that adversely affect, disrupt, or 
interfere with reasonable participation in University activities. Student disruptions or behaviours that 
interfere with university functions on online platforms (e.g. use of Avenue 2 Learn, WebEx, Echo360, 
Microsoft Teams or Zoom for delivery), will be taken very seriously and will be investigated. Outcomes 
may include restriction or removal of the involved students’ access to these platforms.
