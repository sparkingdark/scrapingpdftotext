She/he oversees  the work conducted during a community, volunteer \nor  professional  experience  and  will  verify  the  completion  of  a  minimum  of  60  hours  of  experience.  The \nacademic supervisor evaluates the  relevance of the placement to the student\u2019s academic program and the \nknowledge/experience gained  by the student. He/she must be a Faculty member or Associate member of \nthe Biology Department at  McMaster University. The academic supervisor, in consultation with the student \nwill  determine  the  evaluation  rubric.  Students  are  responsible  for  arranging  a  suitable  placement  and \nacademic  supervision.
